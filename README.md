# COMSW4995-Quickdraw-Kaggle-Challenge

This repository stores the codes we used for the COMSW4995 class project/Google Quick Draw! Kaggle challenge. 

Some codes are adapted from kernels published on Kaggle, as indicated in the jupyter notebook files. 

Kudos to Raghavendra Kotikalapudi who has created this master-piece for ResNet construction: https://github.com/raghakot/keras-resnet
