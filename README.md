# COMSW4995-Quickdraw-Kaggle-Challenge

This is the codes we used for the COMSW4994 class project/Google Quick Draw! Kaggle challenge. 

The codes are adapted from 'beluga' on Kaggle Kernel with modifications. 

Kudos to Raghavendra Kotikalapudi who has created this master-piece for ResNet construction: https://github.com/raghakot/keras-resnet
